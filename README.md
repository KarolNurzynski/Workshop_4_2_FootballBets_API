# Workshop_4_2_FootballBets_API

The aim of this app was to create an API wit access points like:
- list of countries
- list of leagues
- list of leagues from a specifi country
- list of current games' results

These access points will be used in Workshop_4_3 app.

Data provided to API can be created manually or with the use of Faker, or external API like apifootball.com.

I use:
- Jackson for creating JSON representation of data
- Swagger for creating api
